#### *My Style*
* *I didn't know it until recently, but I've always loved to learn. Don't be afraid to teach me something new.*
* *I become obsessed with the things I'm passionate about, and spend time thinking/researching how I can be better at them. I love to share these interests with others, as long as they'd like to listen.*
* *My long term goals are lofty but, I push myself every day to achieve them. I'm curious to hear from my peers and mentors which experiences have been valuable for them in reaching their own personal milestones.*
* *Technology can be the most valuable tool in our tool box, but it can also be the culprit for low productivity and distraction. I make sure that I am using it in the appropriate way, at the correct time and place.*


#### *What I value*
* *I value courtesy and practicality. Treat others with respect, and think through your decisions.*
* *Communication is key, especially when we're working on a project as a team. If the plan feels incomplete, I tend to err on the side of over-communication until the kinks are ironed out and we're all on the same page.*
* *I believe that the office is primarily a place for work, but we can have fun along the way. It's important to develop good relationships with the people around you, and when appropriate, spend time with them.* 
* *In order to be useful, we need to take care of ourselves. It doesn't take much, but a good nights rest and three meals a day can make a huge difference in my ability to perform.*

#### *What I don't have patience for*
* *You should always feel free to ask for help, but I can't solve your problems for you __and__ get my work done at the same time, especially if I don't have experience in the area. I will provide guidance and be an outlet for brainstorming, however we all need to pull our own weight.*
* *We all have expertise in different areas. If you know more than me, don't be condescending about it. Chances are, I'm doing my very best to learn.*
* *I try to ask for help when I need it and look for things to do when I've completed a task. There's no need for micromanagement, it will be distracting and ultimately be harder to stay focused.*

#### *How best to communicate with me*
* *Be direct, and get right to the point. Although, if it's a sensitive matter, finesse will be appreciated.*
* *Details are important to me so long as it serves me to know them. I often like to know the __why__ and __how__ behind the __what__.*
* *I am always open to the possibility that I may be wrong. If you engage with me in that conversation, I will not take it as disrespect. Rather, I will be happy that together we came closer to the truth.*
* *I'm a firm believer that knowledge should be accessible to those who wish to learn. I will gladly share what (if anything) I know with those who are curious if I think it will be received well.*

#### *How to help me*
* *I am a thorough individual. As such, when I am learning something new I tend to take my time so I don't accidentally miss something important. In these moments, your patience will always be appreciated.*
* *I will be receptive to any hints that I need to be doing something better, but encouraging me on what I'm doing well is the best way to see improvement.*
* *I give a lot of attention to detail. Let me know when this is unnecessary so that I can move faster.*

#### *What people misunderstand about me*
* *If a matter seems to be important, I always do my best to understand. Don't confuse my search for clarity as a slight against your idea, I'm simply trying to make sure that I'm on the same page.*

* *I develop extroverted tendencies toward people I am familiar with. If I'm quiet around you, I'm still trying to get to know you (or I'm hungry and tired).*
